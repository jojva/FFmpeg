Installation and execution step by step.

./configure command enables debugging, disables every codecs et muxers/demuxers except for h264 decoder, and avi, mpegts, mpegtsraw and matroska (.mkv) demuxers to build faster.
To try out with other formats/codecs, the right demuxers/decoders have to be enabled.


1째 Install FFmpeg :

git clone https://github.com/jojva/FFmpeg.git

/* In FFmpeg folder : */

./configure --enable-coverage --enable-debug=3 --enable-extra-warnings --assert-level=2 --disable-optimizations --disable-programs --disable-doc --disable-encoders --disable-decoders --enable-decoder=h264 --disable-muxers --disable-filters --disable-demuxers --enable-demuxer=avi --enable-demuxer=mpegts --enable-demuxer=mpegtsraw --enable-demuxer=matroska

sudo make

sudo make install


2째 Build test programs :

/* In FFmpeg/extract folder : */

make


3째 Run :

/* xtract (tries to) extract the frames of a video, in this output order : left eye - right eye - left eye - right eye... 
 * Extraction doesn't work on the first right frames (~6), being mainly green.
 * Next frames are fine, but only reference frames (Intra-frames and Predictive-frames) are extracted and only to a certain point. Around the 300th frame, artefacts begin to appear, and only left frames are extracted.
 * There are important memory leaks, around 1MB/sec. This is due to the fact that packets aren't freed after they've been decoded.
 * Finally, the frames are interlaced, they'll have to be deinterlaced.
*/

./xtract video.MTS
or
./xtract video.MTS &> log


/* pktdumper extracts the demuxed packets of a video */

./pktdumper video.MTS [number of packets to extract]


4째 To see quickly the modifications I've made to the "original" FFmpeg :

/* In FFmpeg/ folder : */

git diff cde1e7d libavcodec/

/* Commit cde1e7d is the last one before this fork of FFmpeg */
