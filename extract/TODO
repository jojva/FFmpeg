Better deinterlacing (yadif instead of avpicture_deinterlace())
Add missing pieces (mpegts sometimes splits 1 VDRD into 2 packets -> merge them)
Fix those big memory leaks (> 1MB/sec)
Be able to extract non-ref frames
Fix green pictures

Mr. Mansencal :
Check the video is MTS
Compare the results with Sony Vegas Pro

For my followers :
Write refs to h264 as much as possible.
Comment the things I've changed in FFmpeg (also in the Mémoire). Say that I used Stéphane Dranger's tutorial and the file doc/examples/filtering_video.c (if it's till relevant) and also pktdumper.c
-> So that it can be picked up by someone else easily
